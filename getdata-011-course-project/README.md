This is a course project for Coursera::getdata-011. It involves downloading a dataset from the internet, combining multiple files, labeling columns and creating a tidy dataset. The main (and only) script in this project is run_analysis.R, which will download the zip file from the internet, unzip it in the local directory and perform all the necessary transformations. Ensure that there is at least 350 MB in the working directory before executing run_analysis.R
